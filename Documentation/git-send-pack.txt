git-send-pack(1)
================
v0.1, July 2005

NAME
----
git-send-pack - Push missing objects packed.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-send-pack' [--all] [--exec=<git-receive-pack>] [<host>:]<directory> [<head>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invokes 'git-receive-pack' on a possibly remote repository, and
updates it from the current repository, sending named heads.


OPTIONS
-------
--exec=<git-receive-pack>::
	Path to the 'git-receive-pack' program on the remote
	end.  Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote
	repository over ssh, and you do not have the program in
	a directory on the default $PATH.

--all::
	Instead of explicitly specifying which refs to update,
	update all refs that locally exist.

<host>::
	A remote host to house the repository.  When this
	part is specified, 'git-receive-pack' is invoked via
	ssh.

<directory>::
	The repository to update.

<head>...:
	The remote refs to update.


Specifying the Refs
-------------------

There are three ways to specify which refs to update on the
remote end.

With '--all' flag, all refs that exist locally are transfered to
the remote side.  You cannot specify any '<head>' if you use
this flag.

Without '--all' and without any '<head>', the refs that exist
both on the local side and on the remote side are updated.

When '<head>'s are specified explicitly, it can be either a
single pattern, or a pair of such pattern separated by a colon
':' (this means that a ref name cannot have a colon in it).  A
single pattern '<name>' is just a shorthand for '<name>:<name>'.
Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon)
and the destination side (after the colon).  The ref that is
pushed is determined by finding a match that matches the source
side, and where it is pushed is determined by using the
destination side.

 - It is an error if <src> does not match exactly one of local
   refs.

 - It is an error if <dst> matches more than one remote refs.

 - If <dst> does not match any remote ref, either

   - it has to start with "refs/"; <dst> is used as the
     destination literally in this case.

   - <src> == <dst> and the ref that matched the <src> must not
     exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched <src>
     locally is used as the name of the destination.
